			As an entrepreneur our CEO, Uddy Carmi, met regularly with friends and colleagues who also ran their startups. A common concern was frequently discussed: they all struggled to find an office that would inspire their teams while aligning with their business goals and projections. Traditional office space is inflexible by nature. Business, in contrast, is extremely dynamic. There had to be a better way. That's when he knew he wanted to get involved in helping shape the future of work.
